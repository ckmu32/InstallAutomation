# InstallAutomation
BASH script that checks "Drop_Folder" for a file, if the file is found. It copies it to a "Installation_Folder" 
and executes a command to restart the service (not implemented, depends on the the service), also it creates 
an automatic Back_Up folder and a folder inside of it with the actual date. Once the file is copied to backup 
it is renamed to the actual date + time.
